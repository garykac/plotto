The Soul, with its human faculties which put it in
immediate touch with the Universe, is a Divine Instrument,
an Aeolian Harp which is not played upon
by the Winds of Chance but by all the Winds of Destiny
that blow from the four quarters of Human
Nature; and this Music of the Soul is a Divine
Harmony which the Creative Imagination, alone
of the human faculties, interprets in Creative Art.
To this high interpretation, through fictional narrative,

<div class="title">INTRODUCTION</div>
<div class="bodytext">
THE PLOTTO METHOD. Plotto achieves creative art in fiction by a new
Method of plot suggestion. Suggestion is based on Themes (or Masterplots)
and Conflicts.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
THEME. Every story has a Theme, or an underlying proposition that indicates its
type. The Theme may be clear-cut and distinct, or shadowy and vague;
it is always in evidence, and differentiates one type of story from all the other
types. Around each Theme any number of distinctly different stories may be
written.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
A story may be constructed with, or without, a certain Theme in mind. Rarely
perhaps does a writer begin a story with a set Theme in front of her. She may
develop her plot from a situation, or Conflict; nevertheless, as the plot develops the
Theme develops with it. The writer will feel the Theme and, consciously or unconsciously,
combine her Conflicts to a certain pattern. This pattern, plain in the
finished work, will conform to a Theme. When a story is built around a Theme,
the Theme becomes a Masterplot.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
The Plotto Method enables the Plottoist to begin her story with a Masterplot
and marshal her situations or Conflicts in conformity to it; or, it enables her to
begin with a situation or Conflict and consciously to watch the particular Theme
as the plot unfolds.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
MASTERPLOTS WITH INTERCHANGEABLE CLAUSES. Each Plotto
Masterplot classifies in general terms and in a single terse sentence a certain type
of story. Each Masterplot consists of three Clauses: An initial Clause defining the
protagonist in general terms, a middle Clause initiating and carrying on the action,
and a final Clause carrying on and terminating the action. Suggestions for exemplifying
the action with concrete situations are offered by the Conflicts.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
THE CONFLICTS. Desire, in some one of its many forms, is responsible for
the awakening of Purpose. Something from without, impinging upon something
within, excites a feeling or an emotion, and the soul flows into Purpose, and Purpose
into action. Then, somewhere on the path of rising action. Purpose encounters
Obstacle. At this point, and at this point only, do we establish what writers of
creative fiction call a situation. Purpose alone never made a situation; Obstacle
alone never made one; but strike the flint of Obstacle with the steel of Purpose and
sparks of situation begin to fly.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
Plotto, as a Method of plot suggestion for writers of creative fiction, is founded
upon this law: Purpose, expressed or implied, opposing Obstacle, expressed or implied, yields Conflict.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
PURPOSES AND OBSTACLES, How many Purposes are there in the world?
Not many, although their variations are infinite. Perhaps, in the last analysis
one General Purpose would comprehend all the Purposes: TO ACHIEVE HAPPINESS. That
is the end and aim of life on this planet. But happiness has a
different meaning for most of us. There is the happiness of love and courtship,
of married life, of achieving wealth or power by all the many methods, good or evil,
that may be contrived by the thinking mind. Religion may be the road to happiness
for some, and revenge the road to a doubtful happiness for others. The virtues or
the faults of a human soul set the pattern of Purpose for that soul.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
Plotto concerns itself with but one General Purpose in its application to three
general goals of endeavor:
</div>
<div class="bodylist">1. To Achieve Happiness in Love and Courtship.</div>
<div class="bodylist">2. To Achieve Happiness in Married Life.</div>
<div class="bodylist">3. To Achieve Happiness (Success) in Enterprise.</div>
<div class="bodylist"></div>
<div class="bodytext">
Yet, while this one General Purpose runs through all the Conflicts, a host of
subordinate Purposes will appear in them, opposed by an infinite number of Obstacles.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
There is one Supreme Purpose in every life: TO LIVE; and there is one Supreme Obstacle
each life encounters: DEATH. Complicating the scheme and
giving zest to the plot of life are innumerable subordinate Purposes and Obstacles,
dealing with all the enterprises of which life is capable.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
Overshadowed by the Supreme Purpose of LIFE, and the Supreme Obstacle
of DEATH, we wage our mimic wars of conquest and gain; but, at any minute,
the Supreme Purpose may fail, and Death come striding into our finite calculations
and calling a truce. There is also a Paramount Purpose in all the lesser activities
of our existence, opposed by a Paramount Obstacle; and they marshal their secondary
Purposes and Obstacles to keep us “on our toes” and fighting valiantly for
all we have, or hope to have. Blessed be Purpose! And thrice-blessed be Obstacle!
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
The Conflicts in Plotto are brief statements of Purpose in active opposition with
Obstacle—situations which are to be combined with other situations. For instance:
“A, in love with B, is not favored by M-B, mother of B.” Here is the
implied Purpose, “To Achieve Happiness in Love,” meeting an Obstacle bluntly
expressed.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
Purpose and Obstacle give concrete exemplification of the Theme in every
form of fictional narrative, whether short story, novelette, or novel.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
THE SHORT STORY. Purpose and Obstacle at grips in one dramatic situation will define
the short story, since it is calculated to leave a single dominant
impression upon the reader’s mind. Ordinarily, this form of narrative fiction will be
woven about a plot of the simplest construction. There will be the main situation
as suggested by a chosen Conflict, the Conflict leading up to it and the Conflict
carrying on and terminating the action. These three Conflicts may be reduced to
two, if the main Conflict should in itself possess the qualities of a terminal Conflict.
Conflicts too long, or too involved, for short story purposes will usually be
found to be broken Conflicts. When such a Conflict is selected for the main situation,
it is possible to use only that part of it which contains the most dramatic
appeal.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
THE NOVELETTE. This form of narrative fiction may be considered as a
long short story, or as a short novel. If the former, the Conflict suggesting the
situation will be elaborated with dramatic material concerned with the Purpose
and Obstacle. If, on the other hand, the novelette partakes of the character of
a short novel, the Paramount Purpose and Obstacle will involve subordinate Purposes
and Obstacles all cumulative in power and bearing upon the story’s climax
or crisis. Here, as everywhere, the imagination must exercise constructive judgment.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
THE NOVEL. The full-fledged novel may be considered as consisting of
several short stories all leading up to, and intimately bound up with, the Paramount
Purpose and Obstacle that give the complete story its unity. Construction here
plays its most discriminating role, for the subordinate situations must grow toward
a single, decisive crisis. The effect must be cumulative. If the main Conflict
shall involve the crisis—and it should—all the subordinate situations dealing with
the Theme will be so selected as to grow naturally in dramatic strength toward the
climax. Here no rules of construction will take the place of taste and discrimination.
The constructive imagination, properly exercised, will deal capably with
the situations, and the creative imagination will work a miracle of dramaturgic
power.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
ORIGINALITY. The Conflicts all come from the vast storehouse of Human
Nature. They are there, millions upon millions of them, waiting for the imagination
to select them and group them in an original combination. For there is “nothing
new under the sun.” Originality in creative work comes from our own individual use
of the tools so bountifully provided by the Divine Creator. All that
is possible to a mortal craftswoman is the combining of old material into something
new and different.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
Originality is the ideal of the Plotto Method; and it is realized by disregarding
the references prefixed and affixed to the Conflicts and (or) interpreting the Specific
as well as the General, Conflicts in terms of the Plottoist’s own experience. Nothing
in the Specific Conflicts will be used literally, but the concrete exemplification
in such Conflicts will serve as a suggestion, lending wings to the creative imagination
for its own high flight.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
For original combinations of Conflicts the Classification by Symbols will be
found a treasure-trove of suggestions. If the main Conflict selected is built around
A, or B, alone, the A or B group should be scanned; if around A and B alone, the
A and B group will yield suggestions, or the A or B group may be found to serve;
or, if several characters are involved in the main Conflict, reference may be had to
that particular group of symbols. If a certain group of symbols proves too limited,
drop one of the lesser character symbols and consult the group represented by those
remaining. This course may be followed, in the search for original combinations,
until only the protagonist remains in the situation. Somewhere along the line of
search the imagination is certain to find exactly what it is looking for.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
CONFLICT GROUPS AND SUB-GROUPS. The Conflicts in Plotto are
classified in three main groups:
</div>
<div class="bodylist">1. Conflicts in Love and Courtship.</div>
<div class="bodylist">2. Conflicts in Married Life.</div>
<div class="bodylist">3. Conflicts in Enterprise.</div>
<div class="bodylist"></div>
<div class="bodytext">
The Conflicts in Love and Courtship are re-grouped as follows:
</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Love’s Beginnings.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Love’s Misadventures.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts of the Marriage Proposal.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Love’s Rejection.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts of Marriage.</div>
<div class="bodylist"></div>
<div class="bodytext">
All the sub-groups are classified, for convenience of reference, under the middle.
or “B,” Clauses of the Masterplots; and these form the only subdivisions of the
main group, “Married Life.” Conflicts of the third group, “Enterprise,” fall into
the following general classifications:
</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Misfortune.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Mistaken Judgment.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Helpfulness.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Deliverance.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Idealism.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Obligation.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Necessity.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Chance.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Personal Limitations.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Simulation.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Craftiness.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Transgression.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Revenge.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Mystery.</div>
<div class="bodylist">Conflicts in Revelation.</div>
<div class="bodylist"></div>
<div class="bodytext">
Inasmuch as dramatic situations are a product of the emotions, and the emotions,
by reason of their complexity, have defied a hard and fast classification, it
follows naturally that the Conflicts themselves will defy a rigid classification. The
groupings noted above are more or less arbitrary, yet they will be bound to serve.
Some Conflicts in Misfortune might easily fall into the sub-groups, Mistaken Judgment,
Simulation, etc., and Conflicts in other sub-groups might logically be re-classified.
Nevertheless, the classification in each case will exemplify in the Conflict
the particular sub-group in which it has been placed.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
MECHANICAL STRUCTURE. There is, of course, a mechanical structure
underlying every properly constructed story. There are some very intelligent
people who believe in the “divine afflatus” as something apart from hard, consistent,
carefully calculated effort. Overlooking the old adage that “Genius is an infinite
capacity for taking pains,” these wise ones will have their back-handed slap at
anything mechanical in its application to Art.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
It remains, however, that a good story must have a carefully developed plot for
its framework; and the plot in itself, is purely mechanical. It is the logical devising
of means to an end, a motivating of all the parts into a harmonious whole. A plot
may be simple, or it may be complex, but an interesting story without some sort
of plot is inconceivable. This machinery must not creak or complain as the story
advances. A discriminating imagination must oil it so well with logic and plausibility
that the god in the machine shall not be ruffled by the turning wheels. Plausibility
is attained when fine discrimination, true judgment and a facility with words
so cover the necessary mechanism that it does not intrude at any point upon the
completed work. And therein lies the art of the story teller. Plotto, at least,
holds this to be true; and, as a corollary of the position thus taken, exalts the
imagination as the greatest force in the world.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
IMAGINATION. If a story is a skeleton structure of plot, overlaid with a
felicity of thought and phrase that may be called the flesh, then the pulsing heart
of the creation, the one factor that gives it life and beauty, is the imagination. But
this imagination must be rightly controlled.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
The demands of fictional narrative would seem to predicate an imagination of
three types: Mediocre, Constructive and Creative. A mind positively brilliant
in its mastery of scientific research, or of the pursuit of trade, might be hopeless in
meeting the demands of fictional narrative. Nevertheless, Plotto believes sincerely
that a desire to write successful fiction is predicated upon the ability to write
successful fiction; and that, given the technical requirements of experience and a
fair education, not often will the mediocre imagination be found hopeless. Intensive
training should develop constructive power; and it is but a step, in the
interpretation of suggestion, from the constructive to the creative. Originality is
the soul of creative art, and originality is nothing more than the interpretation of
suggestion in terms of individual experience.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
Each life is the sum of many experiences, and character indicates the reaction
of those experiences upon the soul. In other words, life is a combination of situations,
or Conflicts, with a spiritual signification drawn from the Conflicts themselves.
So a story plot, which holds the mirror up to life, is a combination of Conflicts,
selected to the pattern of a single Theme, or Masterplot. Life, with
its multitude of experiences, is general; the imagination, dealing with a cross-section
of life, makes the story plot particular. And imagination does this through the
interpretation of suggestion.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
SUGGESTION. The ideal of the Plotto Method, as stated elsewhere, is the
interpretation of Conflict suggestions in terms of individual experience. Some of
the Conflicts are General. Thus, Conflict No. <a href="#31" class="clink">31</a> reads: “B, rescued from an
accident by A, whom he does not know, falls in love with her.” The nature of
the accident, and the character of B and of A, are circumstances left to the constructive
imagination. In dealing with these circumstances, references to other
Conflicts, prefixed and affixed to this general suggestion, will offer further suggestions
for inventing the circumstances.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
Many of the Conflicts are Specific. Thus, to quote Conflict No. <a href="#647" class="clink">647</a>: “B, a
respectable working boy seeking employment, follows the advice of a supposed
friend. A-5, and finds himself in an immoral dance hall where he is compelled to
dance with patrons and serve drinks.” References to other Conflicts will suggest
the cause of B’s necessity for seeking employment, and other references will suggest
a finale for B’s unhappy plight. The constructive imagination might use Conflict
No. <a href="#647" class="clink">647</a> literally, but Plotto would not approve of such literal use. The ideal
method is for the imagination to use the dance hall merely as a suggestion for something
equally pertinent to the situation; in other words, use the concrete example
in interpreting an equivalent for this specific suggestion as to B’s misfortune.
Herein lies the opportunity for originality, and the way to creative work.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
DEVELOPING THE PLOT FROM A MASTERPLOT. For purposes of illustration,
we will select a Masterplot from the Masterplot Chart and build up a
short story plot in tabloid form.
</div>
<div class="bodylist">A   11  A Person Swayed by Pretense,</div>
<div class="bodylist">B   11  (49) Assuming a fictitious character when embarking upon a certain enterprise,</div>
<div class="bodylist">C   2   Emerges happily from a serious entanglement.</div>
<div class="bodylist"></div>
<div class="bodytext">
The B Clause “originates and carries on the action.” Prefixed to this B Clause
in parentheses is the number, (49). On the back of the Masterplot Chart, we find
that No. (49) refers us to a sub-group of Conflicts beginning with Conflict No. <a href="#1173" class="clink">1173</a>,
this particular B Clause serving as a title for the sub-group:
</div>
<div class="conflictid">1173</div>
<div class="prelinks indent"><span class="clinkgroup"><a href="#2" class="clink">2b, c, d, e, g, h</a></span> <span class="clinkgroup"><a href="#1187" class="clink">1187</a> ; <a href="#2" class="clink">2f</a></span></div>
<div class="desc indent">
A, a pretender, encounters B, who is also a pretender * A and B are pretenders,
yet neither knows the other is not what she or he seems to be **
</div>
<div class="postlinks indent"><span class="clinkgroup"><a href="#773" class="clink">773</a> ; <a href="#772" class="clink">772 ch A to B &amp; A-4 to A</a></span> <span class="clinkgroup"><a href="#806" class="clink">806 ch B-4 to B</a></span> <span class="clinkgroup"><a href="#1462" class="clink">1462</a></span></div>
<div class="bodytext">
The reference numbers prefixed to this Conflict offer lead-up suggestions.
Numbers <a href="#1187" class="clink">1187</a> and <a href="#2" class="clink">2f</a> form a complementary suggestion, or a combination of two
Conflicts appropriate to the main situation.
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#1187" class="clink">1187</a>. A is a poor clerk who, with a limited capital, dons a dress suit and takes
a “fling” in high society.
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#2" class="clink">2f *-**</a>. B, poor and humble but pretending to be wealthy and aristocratic, meets
rich and influential A, and they fall in love.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
Thus we have our two pretenders, neither knowing that the other is not what
she or he seems to be. No. <a href="#2" class="clink">2f</a> has a carry-on suggestion:
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#1461" class="clink">1461a</a>. B fights a hard battle with his conscience; he finds it a losing battle
and makes an important revelation in order that he may achieve peace of mind.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
A and not B is the protagonist of <a href="#1461" class="clink">1461a</a>, but we manipulate the Conflict by
changing A to B. This Conflict has a reference, No. <a href="#358" class="clink">358 **-***</a>:
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#358" class="clink">358 **-***</a>. A, in order to win B, is compelled to confess her true rank and station.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
We can now eliminate our main suggestion. Conflict <a href="#1173" class="clink">1173</a>, so that our tabloid
plot will read:
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#2" class="clink">2f *-**</a>. B, poor and humble but pretending to be wealthy and aristocratic, meets
rich and influential A, and they fall in love.
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#1187" class="clink">1187</a>. A is a poor clerk who, with a limited capital, dons a dress suit and takes a
“fling” in high society.
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#1461" class="clink">1461a</a>. B fights a hard battle with his conscience; he finds it a losing battle, and
makes an important revelation in order that he may achieve peace of mind.
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#358" class="clink">358 **-***</a>. A, in order to win B, is compelled to confess her true rank and station.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
We have manipulated the combination Conflict by allowing <a href="#2" class="clink">2f *-**</a> to precede
<a href="#1187" class="clink">1187</a>; and if we keep the reader in ignorance of the fact that A and B are pretenders
and allow the revelation to come at the end of the story, we shall achieve a double
surprise and find ourselves with the plot of O. Henry’s story, “Transients in Arcadia.”
Yet any number of stories, true to the Masterplot, may be built around
these suggestions.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
By changing the first two situations and selecting different Conflicts, the plot
will develop along criminal lines:
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#2" class="clink">2h</a>. B, a criminal, assumes an alias and makes use of stolen funds in evading
the law * B, a criminal in disguise, meets A, and they fall in love **
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#1" class="clink">1c</a>. A, a crook, pretends to be an honest woman in order to forward her love affair
with B.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
Or, we could make our plot more dramatic by having the second situation read:
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#3" class="clink">3a</a>. A is a judge, and B is a fugitive from justice posing as a man of wealth and
fashion * A, a judge, falls in love with B, a criminal **
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
This might be followed with:
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#1292" class="clink">1292</a>. B seeks happiness as a reformed transgressor * B, seeking happiness as a
reformed transgressor, has his old transgression discovered **
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#727" class="clink">727</a>. A, a judge presiding at a murder trial, finds herself unexpectedly confronted
with a circumstance that makes her work a torture to her soul.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
These changes in the plot would make necessary a change in the C clause of
the Masterplot:
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
C (1). Pays a grim penalty in an unfortunate undertaking.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
CONFLICT MANIPULATIONS. Characters in the Plotto Conflicts are
represented by symbols (see “The Plotto Character Symbols,” page 17). These
symbols may be readily changed or transposed, as an aid in manipulating the Conflict
suggestions. Thus, “<a href="#261" class="clink">261 ch A-3 to A</a>,” indicates that A-3 in the Conflict is
to be changed to A; and, “<a href="#578" class="clink">578b tr B &amp; B-3</a>,” indicates a transposition in which
B-3 takes the place of B and B of B-3.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
The character symbols are changed, or transposed, in the auxiliary Conflicts
to agree with the character symbols of the Conflict whose ramifications are being
studied.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
In many instances the Conflicts are “broken”—that is, divided into two or
more parts. The end of the first part is marked with a star (*), of the second part,
with a double star (**), of the third part with a triple star (***), etc. Thus, “-*”
indicates that the Conflict is to be used up to the first star; “*-**” indicates that
the first part of the Conflict is not to be used, but only that part between the first
star and the double star; “-**” indicates that all of the Conflict is to be used up
to the double star, etc.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
DEVELOPING THE PLOT FROM A SELECTED SITUATION. The
most practical way to illustrate the Plotto Method of developing a plot from a
single situation, or Conflict, will be to select a Conflict and follow the Method
through, step by step. For this purpose, the first Conflict, <a href="#1" class="clink">1a</a>, may be used:
</div>
<div class="conflictid">1</div>
<div class="prelinks indent"><span class="subid">a</span><span class="clinkgroup"><a href="#112" class="clink">112</a></span> <span class="clinkgroup"><a href="#117" class="clink">117</a></span> <span class="clinkgroup"><a href="#148" class="clink">148</a></span> <span class="clinkgroup"><a href="#656" class="clink">656</a></span></div>
<div class="desc indent">
A, poor, is in love with wealthy and aristocratic B * A, poor, in love with wealthy
B, pretends to be a woman of wealth **
</div>
<div class="postlinks indent"><span class="clinkgroup"><a href="#209" class="clink">209</a></span> <span class="clinkgroup"><a href="#187" class="clink">187</a></span></div>
<div class="bodytext">
The simplest combination will consist of three Conflicts—the Conflict selected
as the working basis for the plot, the one Conflict leading up to it, and the third
Conflict terminating the action, both auxiliary Conflicts taken from the references
prefixed and affixed to the main, or basic, situation. For example, as a lead-up
Conflict No. <a href="#112" class="clink">112</a> may be used, followed by <a href="#1" class="clink">1a</a>, and this in turn followed by No. <a href="#209" class="clink">209</a>.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
It develops, however, that the second part of the broken Conflict, <a href="#1" class="clink">1a</a>, may be
eliminated; and that, with this elimination, <a href="#1" class="clink">1a -*</a> may logically precede Conflict <a href="#112" class="clink">112</a>,
giving the three-Conflict plot as follows:
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#1" class="clink">1a -*</a>. A, POOR, IS IN LOVE WITH WEALTHY AND ARISTOCRATIC B.

Thus we have A, struggling hopelessly against a character weakness that has
wrecked her financially, forming a platonic friendship for B. If we consider it
expedient to bring about a dramatic first meeting of A with B, the Conflicts are
brimming with such suggestions. But we will not go into that in this skeleton
plot, our object being to simplify the references as much as possible. Conflict
<a href="#1075" class="clink">1075b</a>, a reference appended to <a href="#1075" class="clink">1075a</a>, offers this suggestion as to B’s influence
over A: “A’s admiration for her friend B, and her desire to please him, inspires her
to bring out the best in her nature.” Also appended to <a href="#1075" class="clink">1075a</a> is a reference to
Conflict <a href="#364" class="clink">364d</a>, which seems quite apropos at this point:

This Conflict may be called a terminal Conflict, in the sense that it brings our
love story plot to marriage, the finale of most such plots. But we are not ready,
as yet, to close the action, inasmuch as we are merely leading up to the main situation,
<a href="#1" class="clink">1a</a>; so we shall use only the first part of this broken Conflict: “A, with the
help of B, overcomes an ignoble weakness.”
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
At last we have the male protagonist, B, firmly fixed in the plot, and we need
not go back further into the lead-ups.
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#1079" class="clink">1079</a>. A’s character weakness is betting, and she seems unable to conquer the
failing although she invariably suffers loss.

<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#1075" class="clink">1075a</a>. A, struggling hopelessly against a character weakness, forms a platonic
friendship for B.
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#1075" class="clink">1075b</a>. A’s admiration for her friend B, and her desire to please him, inspires her

</div>
<div class="bodytext">
From this, it is manifest that A’s platonic association with B has gone the way
of most platonic associations (see Conflicts <a href="#9" class="clink">9a, b, c</a>). and her gratitude has blossomed
into love. A, by inference, is so deeply in love with B that the best in her
nature is, for the time, eclipsed by her desire to win B. She resorts to simulation
in forwarding her suit—thinking less of saving her ancestral acres by a wealthy
marriage than she is of her own future happiness. Conflict <a href="#1" class="clink">1a</a> has a reference to
Conflict <a href="#187" class="clink">187</a> for carrying on the action:

A, in love with B and wishing to propose marriage, finds it impossible because B

<div class="bodytext">
We will discard this suggestion, for the reason that it will plunge A deeper into
the questionable methods into which her ardor has already lured her. She is pretending
to be a woman of wealth when she is almost a bankrupt; but she has overcome
her passion for gambling, thanks to B’s influence, and she is ready to husband her
remaining resources and save what she can from the wreck of her material fortunes.
A carry-on suggestion appended to Conflict <a href="#187" class="clink">187</a> is a two-Conflict combination,
<a href="#163" class="clink">163</a> ; <a href="#91" class="clink">91</a>:
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#163" class="clink">163</a>. B learns that his lover, A, has fallen into desperate misfortunes.
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#91" class="clink">91</a>. B, in love with A. seeks to save A from disaster.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
We are now approaching the climax of the action. A’s pretensions to wealth,
B secretly discovers, are a hollow mockery. He learns that she is faced with disaster;
and the Conflicts, if desired, will offer suggestions as to just how he discovers
this secret. B is in love with A and ready to overlook her shortcomings, so he
hastens to her rescue. We will depart, at this point, from the references and show
B, on his own part, indulging in a bit of simulation. Turning to the sub-group.
Simulation, we select Conflict,
</div>
<div class="conflictid">1155</div>
<div class="desc indent">
B, the friend of A, learns that A is desperately involved in debt * B, unknown to A.
settles with A’s creditors and frees her from debt **
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
This happy turn of affairs, naturally, cannot long remain unknown to A. If she
has pride, let her pocket it; or let her pride be humbled by B’s proof of his great
love for her. If this course cannot be made to serve, the Conflicts will offer many
suggestions for estrangement and reconciliation; but, in our plot, we will not have
A a cad. Of the thousands of changes possible in such a series of actions as we are
studying, we could eliminate the Conflicts from <a href="#163" class="clink">163</a>, inclusive, onward and place
A in a better light by using this suggestion from Revelation:
</div>
<div class="bodytext indent">
<a href="#1451" class="clink">1451a</a>. A fights a hard battle with her conscience; she finds it a losing battle, and
makes an important revelation in order that she may achieve peace of mind.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
But we will not make the change. We will proceed to close the action with
Conflict <a href="#364" class="clink">364d *-**</a>: “A’s gratitude to B blossoms into love; and when A is sure she
has rehabilitated her character, she proposes to B and is accepted.”
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
The nature of the Conflicts, and their pliability, often calls for useless repetition.
The statement in <a href="#364" class="clink">364d</a> that “A’s gratitude to B has blossomed into love,” is redundant.
That fact has been known for some time, and has formed the basis for much
of the action; and we simply ignore it here.
</div>
<div class="bodytext">
The latter part of this love story plot would stand as follows:
</div>

In the Classification by Character Symbols, all terminal Conflicts are marked
by the parentheses number of the C Clauses. For instance, <a href="#364" class="clink">364d</a> exemplifies C
Clause (9), “Achieves success and happiness in a hard undertaking.” This Conflict,

Characters in the Plotto Conflicts are represented by symbols. These symbols
indicate the relationship of the auxiliary characters to the protagonist. This relationship
is invariably explained in the text of the Conflicts, with the exception of
the symbols A and B—these being the symbols of the female, and the male, protagonists.
These symbols give a certain uniformity to the characters and facilitate
character changes or transpositions. Protagonist A, or B, might be a criminal, an
officer of the law, an employer, etc., but the numeral is never used in connection with
the protagonist symbol—the explanation is given in the text.
