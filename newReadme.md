This project's goal is to take the raw **Plotto** text and convert it into a format that can be easily parsed and hyperlinked.

## What is Plotto ?
Plotto is an "algebre" for stories that an author (or storyteller) can use to help create works of fiction.

It is a collection of 1462 generic plot conflicts that can be chained together into a "masterplot" that forms the core plot structure for the story.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get a feel of what Plotto offers is to simply jump to a [random plot conflict](https://garykac.github.io/plotto/plotto-mf.html?random) and then begin exploring.

A detailed description of how to use Plotto can be found in the (aptly named) [How to Use Plotto](how-to.md) document.

It is important to note that the conflicts described in Plotto are not intended to be taken literally and applied verbatim. Rather, they are suggesstions that you should adapt to fit the story that you want to
tell.

## Plotto and Modern Times

Plotto was published in the late 20's and was written over the course of the preceding decades. During this period of history the Titani sunk, we learned how to fly, there was a world war, and women gained
the right to vote in the US. Notably missing from this period are the things that we often take for granted in the modern world: many conveniences afforded by advances in technology and significantly, the
notions of civil and equal rights.

While Plotto's disconnect from the modern world can entertaining at times, as in the examples of "dare-devil" activity that include

* a "trick" bicycle rider with a "loop the loop" speciality
* an aviator whose specialty is airplane stunts
* a "human fly" who climbs the walls of tall buildings

the outdated ideas on race can sometimes lead to jarring experiences:

The implicit sexism in Plotto is more subtle, but the rigid structure of the books permits an interesting experiment. Since the protagonist is male and another protagonist is female, we can swap the two roles
and see if any of the resulting text sounds a bit odd.

To experiment with this, you can use the content exactly as the original, except change their characters.
